So to sum up the structure of these contracts

ran command: truffle unbox pet-shop 
    to initiate a skeleton structure 

The contract will be written in a sol file in the contracts folder

Contract code
    contract needs constructor w/ function w/ same name as contract
    by declaring a var public a getter func will be created for it

    Migrations files are the ones that deploy the contracts to the blockchain
    create a file called 2_deploy_contract.js in migrations folder
